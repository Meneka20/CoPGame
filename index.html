                wrongExplanation: "Let's clarify their role. The paper (page 7, 'Individual roles and characteristics') states that implementation moderators are important for 'providing subject expertise, welcoming new members, and facilitating CoP activities,' rather than just enforcement or budget management.",

                wrongExplanation: "Engagement thrives in positive environments. The paper (page 7) recommends 'fostering and promoting social connections and greater sense of community, creating a safe and welcoming environment' to boost engagement, not competition or limiting access.",

                wrongExplanation: "This is a nuanced point. The paper (page 9) warns that overemphasizing 'learning-as-acquisition' (individual knowledge gain) can neglect 'learning-as-participation,' which involves the crucial relational and social aspects that are core to a CoP's functioning and sustainability.",

                options: [
                    "Stronger spontaneous personal bonds.",
                    "Overcoming geographical limitations and time constraints.",
                    "Less need for technical support.",
                    "Easier to ensure everyone has the same level of technological skill."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "You've got it! The paper (page 11) states that virtual CoPs 'can overcome many physical limitations by leveraging technological infrastructure and digital platforms to facilitate asynchronous and synchronous interactions,' helping with distance and time constraints.",
                wrongExplanation: "Consider the digital age. The paper (page 11) notes that a key advantage of virtual CoPs is their ability to 'overcome many physical limitations' like distance and time constraints, by using technology for interaction. While they have their own challenges (like tech skills), this is a primary benefit.",

                    "The specific sociocultural practices and structural context of medical professionals as clinical educators.",

                    "Reducing the role of leadership to encourage grassroots efforts."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Excellent conclusion! A key theme in the discussion (page 9) is the 'absence of a detailed understanding and/or acknowledgement of the effects of the sociocultural practices and structural context of the active medical professional as a clinical educator within a clinical setting.' Taking this context seriously is crucial.",
                wrongExplanation: "Looking ahead is important. The paper (page 9) strongly suggests that future efforts need a deeper understanding of 'the sociocultural practices and structural context of the active medical professional as clinical educator.' This context-specific approach is more emphasized than simply more workshops or rigid models.",
